Hello-folks,

Here is a quick understanding of my simple web page.
here I have used three languages, HTML, CSS, and some of the javascript concepts for making a page.
At first sight, the Page looks attractive and something new with the help of fonts, colors, and some CSS transition and animation.
Javascript is used for the timing of a valid offer.

In conclusion, I will say that The page is sweet and simple.
